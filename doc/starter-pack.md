# Basic Explanations

In order to develop a Sonarqube Plugin in Open source for creedengo, the following basics should have been understood :

- How to develop a Sonarqube plugin
- Understand and work with the Gitflow
- How to develop in open-source mode

## Sonarqube Plugin

Here is the official documentation to understand how to develop a sonar plugin : <https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/extend/developing-plugin/>
But ... we are going to help you more specifically for `creedengo` project in the following sections.

### How a SonarQube plugin works

Code is parsed to be transformed as an [AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). This AST will allow you to access one or more nodes of your code.
For example, you‚Äôll be able to access all of the `for` loops, to explore content etc.

To better understand AST structure, you can use the [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) and select the language of the code you want to explore.

The JavaScript Sonar plugin works differently because it doesn't parse the code to transform it into an AST itself, it uses the ESLint engine which does the parsing by itself ([More information here](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-javascript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)). The good part is that it means that all creedengo JavaScript rules are made available both to Sonar and to [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) through an [creedengo ESLint plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@creedengo/eslint-plugin).

## Gitflow

What is GtiFlow and how it works : <https://medium.com/android-news/gitflow-with-github-c675aa4f606a>

## How to develop in open-source mode
please check following section

## Github Green-Code-Initiative

- common part (doc / tools) : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common>
- rules specification : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-rules-specifications>
- several mobile repositories
- several standard repositories
- several test project repositories

## Some rules references

### 115 web rules details

<https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices>

### 40+ android/iOS rules details

<https://github.com/cnumr/best-practices-mobile>

# Initialize local development

This section is to help you to install and configure your first environment to develop with us !!!

We advise you to use [Sdkman.io](https://sdkman.io/) to manage tools versions of your tools, locally. This tool will install different versions as you want.

## Requirements

- `Docker` : <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>
- `Docker-compose` : <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>
- `Java` JDK (and not only JRE) for Sonarqube plugin Development : <https://www.java.com/fr/download/manual.jsp>
- `Maven` for Sonarqube plugin Development : <https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>
- `Git` : <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>
- `JQ` : <https://jqlang.github.io/jq/>

### Method 1 - Automatic check (default method)

In the current repository, go to `tools/check_requirements` directory.
Next, execute script verification () :

For Mac or Unix OS : `./check_requirements.sh`

For Windows OS :

- execute script : `./check_requirements.bat`
- then check versions displayed

PS : if you have some problems with this script, please feel free to create a new issue here <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/issues>

### Method 2 - Manual check (if above "method 1" doesn't work)

If you want, you can check following file to know what are min and max versions for each tool : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/tools/check_requirements/config.txt>

Then launch check commands as follows (and check versions displayed) :

```sh
docker --version
docker-compose --version
javap -version
mvn --version
git --version
jq --version
```

## Get source code

Clone the project with (standard, mobile or/and common) : please see all availables repositories here <https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/repositories?type=all>

Example for Java plugin (with SSH) :
```sh
git clone git@github.com:green-code-initiative/creedengo-java.git
```

*WARNING* : if you are a new contributor (and not identified project `maintainer`), you have to use FORK / Pull Request System like explained here <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/HOWTO.md#howto-develop-in-open-source-mode>

## Start local environment

You will find all steps to start and configure your local Sonarqube dev Environment here :

- 1st step - build your local plugin: <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/HOWTO.md#howto-build-the-sonarqube-creedengo-plugins>
- 2nd step - launch local Sonarqube (with installation of previous local plugin built) : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/HOWTO.md#howto-install-sonarqube-dev-environment>
- 3rd step - check that local environment is running perfectly :
  - choose one of repositories with suffix "test-project" (ex : <https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-php-test-project/tree/main>) for other languages than Java and Python
    - next, launch script `tool_send_to_sonar.sh` (using previous security token created on the second step)
    - finally, open local SonarQube GUI (<http://localhost:9000>) to verify if the project alone raises creedengo errors
  - For python an Java plugin, please check bottom, ("Specific real test project for Python and Java plugin" part ), there is no test project anymore. It is inside the plugin under `src/it/test-projects` directory

# Implement a new rule

## Requirements

please see section above `Initialize local development`

## Choose the rule you want to implement

Once your local environment is running, you can pick a rule waiting to be implemented.

Many ways to do this : 

- **FIRST WAY** : choose a rule in following tables that is ready to implement (üöÄ) or has to be analyzed (‚ùì)
   - [Web rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-rules-specifications/blob/main/RULES.md)
   - [Android (Java) rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/ecocode-android/blob/main/android-plugin/RULES.md)
   - [iOS (Swift) rules](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-ios/blob/main/RULES.md)
- **SECOND WAY** : pick a plugin in the table bottom and check if a rule is waiting to be implemented.

- **FOURTH WAY** : check rule ideas in Kanban project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/green-code-initiative/projects/1) and select implementable (or hardly implementable) ticket, and create an issue in the right language repositoyr
- **FIFTH WAY** : Go and give a hand to the [spotters team](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-challenge/blob/main/spotters.md) who will give you some rules to implement

**IMPORTANT** : before implementing a rule, please check if the rule is not already implemented in another language and the id already exists in `RULES.md` file or in `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository. If the rule is already implemented, please use the same id.

## FIRST, Declare the new rule / language in `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository

### Choose the ID rule

#### EXISTING RULE, but new language

Use the existing rule id in `RULES.md`.

#### NEW RULE (not already existing)

Use a random number between 1000 and 1500 (ex : "GCI1289") and use it for your code.
Later, during PR reviewing process, you will be asked to change it.

### Technical declaration

#### Content of `creedengo-rules-specifications`

In `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository, here is the content :
- each rule is declared inside directory `src/main/rules` with following requirements :
  - one directory for each rule (ex : `GCI1289`)
    - JSON root file (ex : `GCI1289.json`) : contains SonarQube metadata
    - one sub-directory per language (ex : `python`)
      - ASCIIDOC file (ex : `GCI1289.asciidoc`) : description of rule to be displayed into Sonar

#### UPGRADE : Existing rule, but new language

In `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository, declare the new language :
- inside the rule directory present in `src/main/rules` (ex : `GCI1289`) :
  - add a new sub-directory for new language (ex : `python`)
  - in the new language sub-directory, add the ASCIIDOC file (ex : `GCI1289.asciidoc`)
  - if needed you can add JSON metadata file to override metadata for this language only
- upgrade `CHANGELOG.md`

#### UPGRADE : new rule (not already existing)

In `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository, declare the new rule :
- add the new rule in directory `src/main/rules` with following requirements :
  - one directory for each rule
    - create the directory if new rule (ex : `GCI1289`)
    - upgrade the existing rule directory as follows
  - inside the rule directory (ex : `GCI1289`)
    - add the JSON root file (containing SonarQube metadata) (ex : `GCI1289.json`)
    - one sub-directory per language
      - create the directory for the new langugage (ex : `python`)
      - add the ASCIIDOC file (description of rule to be displayed into Sonar) (ex : `GCI1289.asciidoc`)
- upgrade `CHANGELOG.md`

### Install locally

In order to be used in your plugin, you have to install locally your `creedengo-rules-specifications` compoent, because it is used as a dependency in the plugin.
Inside `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository directory, launch the following command : `mvn install`.
This will install locally the `creedengo-rules-specifications` component in your local maven repository with a SNAPSHOT version. You can see this version in the result console.
Now you can set this version inside de `pom.xml`of your plugin project.

## SECOND, usage inside `creedengo-<LANGUAGE>` repository

### Local `creedengo-rules-specifications` dependency

Once your `creedengo-rules-specifications` component is installed locally (please see previous section), you can use it inside your plugin repository :
- inside `pom.xml`, upgrade the version of the dependency `creedengo-rules-specifications` to use your SNAPSHOT version installed locally
- launch a build of the project

Your plugin is ready to use the new rule for your plugin.

### Develop you rule

You can use an existing example (implementation class) and add your own one.

Inside your plugin project, you can now :
- add a new rule implementation class (and use the `@Rule` annotation ti use the new rule)
- declare this implementation class in the system
- add a new unit test class with at minimum a compliant and an non compliant use case
- add a new integration test with the same minimum (`GCIRuleIT` class) for Java an python plugins : please see section under

## Test your rule implementation

- First kind of test : Unit tests (please check `Definition of Done` above)
- Second kind of test : End-to-End tests in a real local environment (please check `Definition of Done` above and [local procedure](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/starter-pack.md#start-local-environment) )

> Each rule needs to have scripts in a specific language (i.e. Python, Rust, JS, PHP and JAVA) in order to test directly inside Sonarqube that the rule has been implemented.
> To validate that the rule has been implemented, you need to execute a scan on those scripts. You will need sonar scanner: <https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/>

### Specific real test project for Python and Java plugin

These two plugins doesn't have a specific test project yet in a separated repository.
We are deploying in all plugins, a new system to make real tests based on integration tests inside each plugin.
The purpose of this system is to be independent of Docker to launch integration tests.
Now, we needn't Docker to launch integration tests.
We can use a simple maven command to launch a Sonarqube instance and play the integration tests :
```sh
mvn clean verify
```
If you want to keep your local Sonarqube instance, you can use this maven command (using a maven profile) :
```sh
mvn clean verify -Pkeep-running
```

You can find this new real tests system inside `src/it` directory :
- sub-directory `java` contains :
  - system source-code
  - the only one integration test that will be used to launch the integration tests : `GCIRulesIT.java`
- sub-directory `test-projects` contains the real test projects (the old one that was in a separated repository)

## Check `Definition Of Done` for new rule implementation

For a new rule implementation, we strongly recommend you to follow this check-list :

- [ ] Check if rule doesn't exist in our referential rules list yet (`RULES.md` file of `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository)
- [ ] Create PR on the `creedengo-rules-specifications` repository to add the new rule definition
  - [ ] To choose the new rule id :
    - [ ] if rule is already existing in `RULES.md` file or in `creedengo-rules-specifications` module, please use the given rule id
    - [ ] if rule doesn't already exist in `RULES.md` file or in `creedengo-rules-specifications` module, please use a random number between 1000 and 1500 (ex : "GCI1289") and use it (later, you will be asked to change it)
  - [ ] You can use SNAPSHOT version of `creedengo-rules-specifications` during your local rule implementation to go forward
- [ ] Implement rule in your local specific language repository with a reference to local SNAPSHOT of `creedengo-rules-specifications` (previously, install it locally with maven command)
  - [ ] Write Unit tests (and maximize code coverage)
  - [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` file (inside `Unreleased` section)
- [ ] Create PR on the real test project to add a triggering case (check [local procedure](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-common/blob/main/doc/starter-pack.md#start-local-environment))
  - [ ] WARNING Java an Python plugin : check above (`Specific real test project for Python and Java plugin`)
- [ ] Fix potential SonarCloud issues / out-of-date warnings (report is sent after creating PR)
- [ ] In next review step, reviewer will ask you to use a specific id rule if you have chosen a random one


# Publish your work

## Commit your code

Create a new branch following this pattern : <rule_id>-<language>
Example :

```sh
git checkout -b 47-JS
```

Commit your code :

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "your comments"
```

Push your branch :

```sh
git push origin <rule_id>-<language>
```

You may have to login with your account : <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>

## Open pull request

Once your code is pushed and tested, open a PR between your branch and "main" : <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>

## Review others development

Ask to people to review your PR. Once two people, at least, have reviewed, you can validate your PR
If you want to be reviewed, review others... It's a win/win situation

## Validation of a PR

Validate your PR or ask to someone who have the permissions to validate your PR.
Once PR validated, a github workflow is automatically launched. Thus, the new implemented code is also scanned with our internal Sonar to check the implemented code quality.
Here is the SonarQube : <https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/green-code-initiative/projects>

## Close your rule

Once your PR is validated, your rule integrates creedengo. In <https://github.com/cnumr/creedengo/projects/1>, move it from the "In Progress" column to the "Done" column.
Well done.
